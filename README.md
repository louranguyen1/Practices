<br>

- DFSGraph - create a DFS graph
- FA - creates a DFA that accepts string literals
- FAChar - creates a DFA that accepts character literals
- Graph - creates an adjacency matrix and displays the DFS path/neighbors
- lexemeFile - takes in a text file and splits it into lexemes, identifies what they are, and if they have any syntax errors
- lexemeInput - takes in user input and splits it into lexemes that are considered separate tokens.
- mystery - creates a TreeNode and prints out specific node
- AandB - finding odd numbers of a's and b's
- separator - creates a program that separates letters and number
- comments - takes user inputs and checks if they are single-line or multiline comments

<br>

- practices:
	- finds the max number in an array
	- finds 2 elements from the array that add up to the target sum
	- adds the 2 arrays together
	- finds the missing number in the patterned array
	- prints out the most repeated number in an array
	- adds up all the selected numbers so you can get the highest number
        	- for every number that you choose, a number next to it has to be skip
        	- for every number that you choose, you can't skip more than 1 number
<br>

- MinHeap - checks if the array is min heap and inserts another
- treeNode - prints the nodes in decreasing order and lists the leaves from right to left
- QueueStack - push and pop methods in queue stack
- Trie - finds the longest common prefix
- Graph - prints out a graph matrix
- LinkedList - adding, reversing, checking, and deleting nodes in linked list
- LinkedList2 - removing duplicates in a linked list
